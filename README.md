# 🗳️ Digital Voting and Election Management System

## 📌 Problem Statement

In many traditional voting systems, the process of managing voter eligibility, preventing multiple votes, tracking real-time results, and auditing user activity is manual and error-prone. These weaknesses can lead to:
- Voting fraud (e.g., multiple voting)
- Ineligible voter participation
- Difficulties in result tracking and auditing
- Poor transparency and scalability

This project proposes a **Digital Voting and Election Management System** developed using **PL/SQL** and Oracle technologies to address these issues through:
- Automated vote recording
- Eligibility verification
- Real-time result tracking
- Secure audit logging and rule enforcement



## ⚙️ Methodology

The system was developed across **seven structured phases**, each contributing to the overall functionality and robustness:

1. **Phase I**: Project Topic Selection – Voting system
2. **Phase II**: Business Process Modeling (BPMN)
3. **Phase III**: Logical Data Modeling (ER Diagram)
4. **Phase IV**: PDB Setup and User Creation
5. **Phase V**: Physical Table Implementation and Sample Data Insertion
6. **Phase VI**: PL/SQL Procedures, Functions, and Sequences
7. **Phase VII**: Triggers and Auditing for Business Rule Enforcement

Technologies used:
- Oracle SQL Developer
- Oracle PDB (Pluggable Database)
- PL/SQL (Procedures, Functions, Triggers)
- GitHub for code management

## 🧪 Screenshots and Explanations

### 📌 Explanations:

- **Table Creation**: The system defines normalized tables for `Voters`, `Elections`, `Candidates`, `Votes`, and `Results`.

![Candidates Table](https://github.com/Audace011/VotingSystem_PLSQL_Capstone_2025/blob/main/PHASE%20V/candidates.PNG?raw=true)
![Elections Table](https://github.com/Audace011/VotingSystem_PLSQL_Capstone_2025/blob/main/PHASE%20V/elections.PNG?raw=true)
![Candidates Insert Script](https://github.com/Audace011/VotingSystem_PLSQL_Capstone_2025/blob/main/PHASE%20V/candidates%20ins.PNG?raw=true)
- **Procedure Execution**: `cast_vote` ensures that voters are eligible and haven't already voted before inserting a record.

- **Triggers**: Prevent voting after deadlines and duplicate voting.
- ⛔ Trigger: Prevent Voting After Deadline

![Trigger – After Deadline](https://github.com/Audace011/VotingSystem_PLSQL_Capstone_2025/blob/main/PHASE%20VII/trg%20after%20deadline%20creation.PNG?raw=true)

📝 *This trigger enforces election deadlines by preventing any vote from being cast after the official election date. It raises a custom error if the system date is past the election date.*

 🔄 Trigger: Prevent Duplicate Voting

![Trigger – Duplicate Voting](https://github.com/Audace011/VotingSystem_PLSQL_Capstone_2025/blob/main/PHASE%20VII/trg%20double%20voting%20creation.PNG?raw=true)

📝 *This trigger checks if the voter has already voted in the same election. If a duplicate vote attempt is detected, it raises an application error to block the action and preserve vote integrity.*

- **Audit Logging**: A separate `Vote_Audit` table captures voter actions, improving transparency and traceability.

 Audit Logging – `Vote_Audit` Table

![Vote Audit Log](https://github.com/Audace011/VotingSystem_PLSQL_Capstone_2025/blob/main/PHASE%20VII/audit%20logging.PNG?raw=true)

📝 *This screenshot displays the contents of the `Vote_Audit` table. It shows the audit trail automatically generated by the `trg_vote_audit` trigger — logging who voted, for which candidate and election, when it happened, and under which user account.*

## ✅ Project Outcomes

- Prevented double voting using both procedures and triggers
- Validated voting eligibility before recording a vote
- Logged each voting action for auditing
- Enforced time-based voting restrictions
- Provided a clear and testable PL/SQL implementation
